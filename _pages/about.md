I am a third year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), set to graduate in 2025, majoring in **Mathmatics**. Currently, I am researching Computer Vision under the guidance of Prof. [Zejian Yuan](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37399214700).
